# Go-Live

## Overview
Go Live is an [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) based live-streaming service. After creating an account, users can stream video from [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (or another prefered streaming software) to Go Live's HLS server. The server will broadcast the stream to anyone who joins it's room through the Go Live web-app. Other cool features include:

* Text chat for every room.
* Users being able to set thier own profile pictures.
* Rewindable streams up to 5 minutes behind.
